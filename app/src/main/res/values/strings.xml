         The fundamental size of a screen, as indicated by the shortest dimension of the available screen area. Specifically, the device\'s smallestWidth is the shortest of the screen \'s available height and width (you may also think of it as the "smallest possible width" for the screen). You can use this qualifier to ensure that, regardless of the screen\'s current orientation, your app\'s has at least dps of width available for its UI.

For example, if your layout requires that its smallest dimension of screen area be at least 600 dp at all times, then you can use this qualifier to create the layout resources, res/layout-sw600dp/. The system uses these resources only when the smallest dimension of available screen is at least 600dp, regardless of whether the 600dp side is the user-perceived height or width. The smallest width is a fixed screen size characteristic of the device; the device\'s smallest width doesn\'t change when the screen\'s orientation changes.

Using smallest width to determine the general screen size is useful because width is often the driving factor in designing a layout. A UI will often scroll vertically, but have fairly hard constraints on the minimum space it needs horizontally. The available width is also the key factor in determining whether to use a one-pane layout for handsets or multi-pane layout for tablets. Thus, you likely care most about what the smallest possible width will be on each device.

The smallest width of a device takes into account screen decorations and system UI. For example, if the device has some persistent UI elements on the screen that account for space along the axis of the smallest width, the system declares the smallest width to be smaller than the actual screen size, because those are screen pixels not available for your UI.

Some values you might use here for common screen sizes:

    320, for devices with screen configurations such as:
        240x320 ldpi (QVGA handset)
        320x480 mdpi (handset)
        480x800 hdpi (high-density handset)
    480, for screens such as 480x800 mdpi (tablet/handset).
    600, for screens such as 600x1024 mdpi (7" tablet).
    720, for screens such as 720x1280 mdpi (10" tablet).

When your app provides multiple resource directories with different values for the smallestWidth qualifier, the system uses the one closest to (without exceeding) the device\'s smallestWidth.

Added in API level 13.

Also see the android:requiresSmallestWidthDp attribute, which declares the minimum smallestWidth with which your app is compatible, and the smallestScreenWidthDp configuration field, which holds the device\'s smallestWidth value.
